# Quickstart
### Step 0
Download the latest version of the application from GitHub: https://github.com/LeagueOfPoro/CapsuleFarmerEvolved/releases
### Step 1
After downloading the zip file from GitHub you need to extract it

### Step 2
When extracted, open the `config.yaml` in a text editor (e.g. Notepad) and put your username and password in there. You can remove unnecessary accounts from the config - the default configuration file is an example for two accounts.

- Yellow is what the farmer shows, you can change it to anything like your username or in-game name or even leave the default value

- Green is your username that you use to log in at RIOT with (make sure to put the username inside the quotation marks)

- Blue is your password that you use to log in at RIOT with (make sure to put the username inside the quotation marks)

### Step 3
Now you are ready to start the CapsuleFarmerEvolved.exe

You might experience that the computer wants to block the software when you start it, something like this. Then you need to press “More info” and then “Run anyway”

### Step 4
Now the program should start and look something like this. When the status is LIVE the program is running correctly, and in Live matches you see all the streams that the farmer is watching at the moment.

## Possible issues
### Heartbeat is not updating 	
If you notice that the Heartbeat is not updating every few minutes, you might have left-clicked somewhere in the window. You will see this little white square.  When there is a square, Windows freezes all the text in the window to allow copying text. The program is still running in the background! To unfreeze the window, you simply need to right-click.

If the heartbeat doesn't change within a few minutes, try restarting the program.

### I see error messages
If the heartbeat updates every minute or so, the program recovered by itself and is running fine.
